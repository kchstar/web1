    <a href="D:\Photo\001806" target="_blank">
    pages and user</a> interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document,
     including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with 
     HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging
